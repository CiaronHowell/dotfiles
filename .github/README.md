# .dotfiles

Nice-looking and **blazingly fast** terminal in seconds, *or your money back*.

## Installation

* Install [yadm](https://yadm.io/docs/install)
  * Adds a wrapper around `git` so it works exactly how you'd expect when using `git`
* Run `yadm clone <repo_url>`
  * Brewfile should automatically start installing, but if this doesn't happen you can run `yadm bootstrap`
* Restart your ZSH instance (also contains Fish configs)

## Contents

NVIM Config is located [here](./.config/nvim/).
